The (bad) visualization I have chosen was found in the following article when I was googling nutritional information about peaches: https://draxe.com/nutrition/peach-nutrition/

This image is a horrible visualization as the numbers don't relate to the visualization and there is a complete absence of any real scale. It's not clear what the bars represent, but we can assume it's meant to be %DV as the vitamin amounts would not make sense, scale-wise. Assuming they represent %DV, we can we that upon any inspection these bars are wrong: why is the 8% bar more than half of the 16% bar, why is the 2% bar almost half of the 8% bar? Instead of aiding in understanding, this visual misleads the reader-- I would've just been better off with a list of the information instead of a graphic. This visual could have been good, as it uses length and (theoretically) a common scale, but the execution did not follow through. The reader cannot ratio the bars and glean any (correct) information from this figure. 

BMB: I agree, this looks pretty terrible. The bar lengths do at least look **approximately** commensurate with the %DV values (they're in the right order). (I don't know if you can "ratio" something, although technically you can verb any noun in English ...) It would be mildly interesting to use a data scraper to see what scales these actually corresponded to, although the qualitative points you make do prove that it can't be sensible.

mark: 2.5 (good)
